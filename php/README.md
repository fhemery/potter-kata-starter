# Potter Kata - PHP

Skeleton to start the Potter Kata in PHP : https://codingdojo.org/kata/Potter/

## Installing

You need a working PHP version, and [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed

Just run:
> composer install

## Running the tests
Your IDE should be able to launch the tests easily, but if you want to launch from command line:

> ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests

One of the two tests should fail. It's all good, you're ready to work.
