# Potter kata - Typescript starter

Skeleton to start the Potter Kata in PHP : https://codingdojo.org/kata/Potter/

## Installing 

This starter uses [NX](https://nx.dev) for convenience.

To install, as usual just run:

> npm i

## Running tests

Your IDE can generally do it, but if you need command line: 

> npm test -- kata

The first time you run it, one of the tests should fail.
